# Contributing to dsh-files / 参与 dsh-files 共建

Thank you for helping improve `dsh-files`. This repository is the
**Cooberped community fork** of [`taxueseek/dsh-files`](https://github.com/taxueseek/dsh-files).
We preserve the upstream Git history, attribution, and MIT notice while
maintaining an independent community release.

感谢你参与 `dsh-files`。本仓库是
[`taxueseek/dsh-files`](https://github.com/taxueseek/dsh-files) 的
**Cooberped 社区维护 fork**。我们保留上游 Git 历史、署名和 MIT 声明，并独立维护社区发行版。

## Before you start / 开始之前

- Search existing issues and pull requests before opening a duplicate.
- Open an issue before a large feature, parser replacement, storage-format
  change, public API change, or security-sensitive refactor.
- Do not put private documents, HR data, credentials, API keys, session data,
  or customer data in issues, tests, fixtures, logs, screenshots, or commits.
- Reproduction files must be synthetic, minimal, and redistributable.
- Security vulnerabilities must follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), not a public
  issue.

提交前请先检索现有 Issue/PR。大型功能、解析器替换、存储格式或公开接口变化、
安全敏感重构应先开 Issue 对齐。严禁提交真实业务文档、人力资源数据、凭据、API
密钥、会话数据或客户数据；复现文件必须是合成、最小且可再分发的材料。

## Development / 本地开发

Use the Node.js range declared in `package.json` and a Corepack-provided pnpm.
Do not regenerate the lockfile with an unrelated package manager.

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

During development, run the smallest relevant test first. Before requesting
merge, run the repository checks affected by your change. Parser and retrieval
changes should include focused contract tests; UI changes should include a
targeted browser journey or reproducible manual evidence.

开发阶段优先运行与改动直接相关的 focused tests。请求合并前，再运行受影响的仓库
检查。解析和检索改动必须补充契约测试；UI 改动应提供 targeted browser journey
或可复现的人工证据。

Generated `lib/` files are tracked. If you change `src/`, run `pnpm build` and
include the matching generated output in the same pull request. Do not hand-edit
generated files.

Files in `assets/readme/` are generated from `assets/source/` by
`pnpm assets:build`; `pnpm assets:check` runs in the release gate. Change a
diagram by editing its source and rebuilding, never by hand-editing the SVG.

`assets/readme/` 下的文件由 `assets/source/` 经 `pnpm assets:build` 生成，
`pnpm assets:check` 已接入发布 Gate。修改配图请改源码后重新生成，不要手改 SVG。

`README.md` and `README.zh.md` are a translated pair. When you edit one side,
bring the other along in the same pull request and re-record both blob hashes in
[`.github/readme-i18n.yaml`](.github/readme-i18n.yaml) with `git hash-object`.

`README.md` 与 `README.zh.md` 是翻译对照关系。改动任意一侧时，请在同一个 pull
request 中同步另一侧，并用 `git hash-object` 重新记录
[`.github/readme-i18n.yaml`](.github/readme-i18n.yaml) 中的两个 blob 哈希。

## Scope and design expectations / 范围与设计要求

- Keep pull requests narrow and explain any user-visible behavior change.
- Preserve session isolation, path containment, upload limits, parser limits,
  and fail-closed behavior. A convenience change must not weaken them.
- Keep document coordinates stable (`page`, `slide`, `sheet`/`range`) and add a
  migration note before changing an indexed or persisted representation.
- Avoid adding a large runtime or external service when a smaller local solution
  meets the same contract.
- A dependency addition needs a reason, package-size impact, license review,
  maintenance assessment, and focused tests.
- Do not mix unrelated formatting, dependency, and behavior changes.

## Commit sign-off (DCO) / 提交签署（DCO）

This project uses the [Developer Certificate of Origin 1.1](https://developercertificate.org/)
and **does not require a Contributor License Agreement (CLA)**. Every commit
must contain a `Signed-off-by` trailer certifying that you have the right to
submit the contribution under this project's license:

```bash
git commit -s -m "feat: describe the change"
```

The trailer must use your real name and a reachable email identity:

```text
Signed-off-by: Example Contributor <contributor@example.com>
```

If a commit is missing the trailer, amend or rebase it; do not add another
person's sign-off. 贡献者无需签署 CLA，但每个 commit 都必须有本人 DCO sign-off，
用以确认你有权按本项目许可证提交该贡献。

The one-time public-repository bootstrap preserves the pre-policy development
history through commit `ba6cead1b33a5bc53449918350be7618504076bf` without
retroactive sign-off. Rewriting or signing another author's historical commits
would weaken provenance. The DCO requirement applies to every contribution
created after that legacy-import boundary. This exception is closed and must
not be extended to later commits.

首次公开仓库保留截至上述 commit 的治理前开发历史，不追补他人签名；该边界之后
创建的所有贡献均须遵守 DCO，且不得扩大此一次性例外。

Dependabot's own commits are exempt. They are machine-generated, carry no
trailer, and a bot has nothing to certify — without the exemption every
dependency update would be blocked forever. The exemption is narrow: the check
requires both the pull request and the commit to be authored by
`dependabot[bot]`, so the identity cannot be borrowed, and a human commit
riding along in a bot pull request is still checked.

Dependabot 自身的 commit 属于例外：它们由机器生成、不带 trailer，机器人也没有可
供声明的著作权；不设例外的话，所有依赖更新都会被永久挡住。该例外范围很窄——检查
要求 PR 与 commit 的作者同为 `dependabot[bot]`，因此身份无法被借用；机器人 PR 中
夹带的人类 commit 仍会被检查。

## Pull-request process / PR 流程

1. Fork the repository and create a topic branch from current `main`.
2. Make a focused change with tests and documentation where relevant.
3. Confirm every post-bootstrap commit has its author's DCO sign-off.
4. Complete the pull-request template, including exact validation commands.
5. Wait for required checks and a human maintainer review.
6. Address review comments with new commits; avoid force-pushing while a review
   is active unless the reviewer agrees.
7. A maintainer merges after approvals and required checks pass, normally using
   squash merge. GitHub auto-merge may execute that already-approved decision;
   it does not replace human approval.

社区贡献者通过 fork + PR 提交。CI 负责自动检查，维护者负责人工审查和最终合并。
自动合并只允许在人工批准、必需检查全部通过之后执行，不代表机器人自动批准代码。

Maintainers may close a pull request that is unsafe, out of scope, abandoned,
unlicensed, missing provenance, or impossible to validate. This is a technical
and stewardship decision, not a judgment of the contributor.

## Licensing and provenance / 许可证与来源
